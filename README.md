### SpringBoot Marketplace Backend

This is a course project by Keval and Debanjan for the course "Principles of Distributed Software (2025)".

This Project includes:
  - We created 3 separate services - users, wallet and marketplace.
  - We tested the code for handling concurrent requests.
  - Each service can be deployed as separate containers and connected using http.
